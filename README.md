### 📋 Executive Summary | الملخص التنفيذي
This repository provides a high-level overview of the **Heyad National Governance Framework**, a proprietary Enterprise Architecture solution designed to address complex national-level challenges.

The framework utilizes **Systems Thinking**, **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**, and **Algorithmic Governance** to decouple executive functions from oversight bodies, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and meritocracy.

يقدم هذا المستودع نظرة عامة على "إطار عمل مبادرة حياد"، وهو حل معماري مؤسسي مصمم لمعالجة التحديات الوطنية المعقدة باستخدام "التفكير النظمي" والحوكمة الرقمية.

### 🏛️ Architecture Pillars | ركائز البنية المعمارية
The solution is engineered around four core digital systems:

#### 1. Centralized EPMO (مكتب إدارة المحافظ المركزي)
A strategic governance body designed to manage national portfolios and ensure alignment with sovereignty goals using **Pareto Analysis (80/20)** for critical path identification.

#### 2. "Tataabue" Succession System (نظام التتابع)
An algorithmic meritocracy system designed to manage human capital and leadership succession. It decouples the "recruitment authority" from "executive institutions" to eliminate conflict of interest.

#### 3. "Dhahir" GRC Program (برنامج ظاهر)
A continuous transparency monitoring system acting as a **GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)** platform, linking institutional performance directly to public KPIs.

#### 4. Central Data Warehouse (المحفظة المركزية)
A unified data repository consolidating economic resources and social metrics to support **Data-Driven Decision Making** for the Sovereign Fund.
